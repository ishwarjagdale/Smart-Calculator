## Syntax
```
calculator.py
```

## Stages
**Stage #1 2 + 2**  
Your calculator is taking its first steps: teach it to calculate the sum of two integers and display the result on the screen.

**Stage #2 2 + 2 +**  
Enable your calculator to keep adding numbers in a loop until the user enters “exit”.

**Stage #3 Count them all**  
Using lists and strings, make it possible to calculate sums of multiple integers.

**Stage #4 Add Substractions**  
Where there is a plus, there is a minus. Using your knowledge of lists and strings, enable the calculator to deal with subtraction as well as addition.

**Stage #5 Error!**  
There’s no math without errors: teach your program to alert the user to errors in the case of invalid input.

**Stage #6 Variables**  
Working with dict, enable the calculator to use variables.

**Stage #7 I've got the power**
Time to upgrade and add even more possible operations: multiplication, division, powers, and calculations in parentheses.
